Welcome to arch2darcs, a program for converting Arch repositories to
Darcs.

FEATURES
--------

arch2darcs is used to convert an Arch repository to Darcs,
automaticaly preserving:

 * All original logs
 * Modification dates
 * All adds, deletes, and renames that were versioned with tla
 * Files in Arch.

arch2darcs can process entire Arch/tla branches at once.

I wrote arch2darcs because tla2darcs:

 * Didn't handle renames properly
 * Lacked good support for importing a whole branch at once
 * Seemed crash-prone

PREREQUISITES
-------------

To build arch2darcs, you need:

 * GHC 6.2 or above
   http://www.haskell.org/ghc/
   (if you built darcs from source, you have this already)

 * Cabal (only needed if you aren't using GHC 6.4 or above)
   http://www.haskell.org/cabal/
   
 * MissingH 0.10.6 or above
   http://quux.org/devel/missingh

BUILDING
--------

Type "make".  The binary will be in dist/build.  You can install it
with ./setup install.

CONVERTING ENTIRE ARCH BRANCH
-----------------------------

To convert an entire Arch branch, the overall procedure is:

 1. Check out base-0 from that branch
 2. Initialize the working directory for darcs
 3. Add _darcs to {arch}/=tagging-method backup line
 4. Run arch2darcs -i

Example:

$ tla get jgoerzen@complete.org--projects/missingh--head--0.5--base-0 missingh

  *** IMPORTANT NOTE: make sure you include "--base-0" from the above
      command.

$ cd missingh
$ darcs initialize
$ vim {arch}/=tagging-method
  Change the exclude line to (one example):
  backup ^.*(~|\.~[0-9]+~|\.bak|\.orig|\.rej|\.original|\.swp|\.modified|\.reject|_darcs)$

$ arch2darcs -i
Processing existing Arch situation...
Looking for new patches...
Processing jgoerzen@complete.org--projects/missingh--head--0.5--patch-1
...
Processing jgoerzen@complete.org--projects/missingh--head--0.5--patch-145
Done.

CONVERTING BRANCH TAGS
----------------------

With Arch, when one branches, one "tags" the source to the
destination.  It's common practice to cease development on one branch
and then begin on the next in the Arch world.  You can use arch2darcs
to do this.  Start by importing the oldest branch as shown above.
Then follow this example, which shows moving from an 0.5 to an 0.7
branch and then following history there:

( assuming you're still in missingh/ from earlier )
$ tla sync-tree jgoerzen@complete.org--projects/missingh--head--0.7--base-0

  *** ONCE AGAIN, notice the presence of base-0!
$ tla set-tree-version jgoerzen@complete.org--projects/missingh--head--0.7
$ arch2darcs -i
Processing existing Arch situation...
Looking for new patches...
Processing jgoerzen@complete.org--projects/missingh--head--0.7--patch-1
...

UPDATING EXISTING CONVERSION
----------------------------

Maybe you want to make a Darcs mirror of an Arch repository.  Once you
have the Darcs version converted as described above, you can simply
run arch2darcs periodically (without the -i).  It will convert and
apply all new patches in the Arch repository to Darcs.  Nifty, eh?

TROUBLESHOOTING / FAQ
---------------------

 * I'm getting conflicts from tla during the replay.  What's going on?

   You probably need to adjust the backup rule in
   {arch}/=tagging-methods.

   Or, perhaps you've done this and there's a conflict due to a change
   to =tagging-methods itself.  Just merge the change manually, then
   run arch2darcs -i to start up where you left off.
